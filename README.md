# Password_Generator
Simple console-based application for generating passwords and checking their strength using Java.

## Functionalities
### 1. Generating a password
   - The user answers with "Yes" or "No" to questions about using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
   - The user then enters the desired length of the password.
   - A string is generated based on the user's answers, which contains all the chosen characters.
   - Random characters from the password alphabet are selected and combined to form a completely random string according to the user's preferences.

### 2. Checking a password's strength
  - The strength is checked on the basis of the following criteria:
    - The password uses uppercase letters.
    - The password uses lowercase letters.
    - The password uses numbers.
    - The password uses symbols.
    - The length of the password is at least 8.
  - These criteria are used to calculate a score for the password which determines its strength (Strong/good/fair/weak).
